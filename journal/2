MASTERPIECE

5/12/2018 12:35 PM

You idiot. You numbskull. This is terrible. This is nothing. You're terrible. You're nothing. Everything in your life has always been a failure and this will be no different. You dipshit. You waste of space.

It's not important what happens, but it is important that something happens, every day.

One commit per 24 hours, that's what we're committed to.

It's allowed to be shitty.

Your girlhood is allowed to be shitty.

You don't have to look like anything. You don't have to be anything. You don't have to do anything.

Please stop hurting yourself.

Please stop hurting yourself. Please stop hurting yourself. Please stop.

There's nothing to it, just make a masterpiece! Just let your skills go. Just do easy things until they add up to a hard thing.
